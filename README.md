# num_guess

Write a complete C++ program that implements a number guessing game. 

First, have the program generate a random number in the range 1 to 100. 
Continually prompt the user to guess the number. (consider the rock paper scissors starter code)

Have the user enter a number from the keyboard. 
If the guess is correct, congratulate the user, telling them how many guesses it took to reveal the number. 
If the guess in not correct, **supply a hint,** telling the user whether the number is higher or lower than the guess they supplied, then prompt the user again and read the next guess. 

In your program, allow the user the ability to play multiple times, using a sentinel value to let the user inform the program when they are finished. As each iteration of the game begins, display a banner, informing the user of the rules of the game.

Make sure you write a complete C++ program. You may use additional variables as necessary. 
Add judicious comments
to document your code.Include a header, like the one from previous labs, displaying your name, the date, and the course number.
